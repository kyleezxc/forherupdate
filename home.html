            <p>I'll get this chance to confess on you about my feelings.</p>
            <p>This might ends up our friendship, closeness but i still hope that you'll listen.</p>
            <p>I know that it's too obvious that i like you, even on my post, notes, mydays.</p>
            <p>To be honest, i am afraid to tell you about my feelings. Afraid of rejection.</p>
            <p>The day i first met you, I'm amazed of your beauty and cuteness(seryoso idol-idol ra unta tika before, pero ambot ngano).</p>
            <p>Seryoso te, ambot lang ngano kaha ay. trip-trip ragyud to nako before sulti nako nilang rendyl na (idol oh). pero nadayunan man HAHAHAAHA</p>
            <p>I wanted to court you to know you more, but base on what you shared on me. what i see, you're not ready yet and sa akong nakita pud i don't have a chance.</p>
            <p>I am doing my best at school kay inspired ko because of you like deym, achievement na raba na nako nga nausab ako grade tungod nimo(nisaka te).</p>
            <p>Like what i said to you before, maybe ig sembreak or christmas ko mo confess. I don't know if you already knew but i just want you to know that i like you since day one.</p>
            <p>and i wanted you to know also that i'm always here if you need something, or if you need help. I am always free !</p>
            <br>
            <span class="admire">Admiring you from afar</span>
            <p>Please enjoy the music ^^</p>
